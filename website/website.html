	<h2>Project Background</h2>
	<p> This project is a math game program for kids between 6 to 8 years old. It is aiming to improve their calculation skills and also help kids understand the meaning of “equal”.  This game contains different levels so it can fit students in different ages. This program will be written in python 3.4 and will executed on windows OS system. It needs installation of the python 3.4 environment for running the program.</p>
	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>This game will consist of a grid of math problems, and a list of "pieces" that contain numbers or equations that are equivalent to those math problems.  Each piece can be placed in the grid on top of their correct match like a puzzle.  The object of this game is to match as many pieces to the grid before the timer runs out.  The game will also include difficulty levels to set what kind of math concepts will show up in the grid (addition, subtraction, and eventually multiplication and division etc.) </p>
